Hardware and Hardware Documentation License

CERN Open Hardware Licence

This applies to the kicad-files and scad-files directories.

"Documentation" means schematic diagrams, designs, circuit or circuit
board layouts, mechanical drawings, flow charts and descriptive text,
and other explanatory material that is explicitly stated as being made
available under the conditions of this Licence. The Documentation may be
in any medium, including but not limited to computer files and
representations on paper, film, or any other media.


Software License

GPL v3 or any later version

This applies to the OpenHardwareExG_firmware and src directories.

(The authors may be persuaded to license parts of their contributions
under another FOSS license if GPLv3 is a problem for integration with an
existing established project, for instance linux kernel is GPLv2. Please
contact us.)
